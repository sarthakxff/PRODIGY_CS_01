# PRODIGY_CS_01
This Python program implements the Caesar Cipher, a basic encryption technique. It takes plaintext and a shift value from the user, encrypts the text by shifting alphabetic characters forward, and decrypts it by reversing the shift. Letter case is preserved and non-alphabetic characters remain unchanged.
